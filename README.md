# ST-558-Final-Project

# Welcome!

Here's my final project!

## Instructions for Running

```
library(shiny)

runGitHub("ST-558-Final-Project", "kylebeard56", ref = "master")

runApp()
```

Note: When I tried to do testing, I was getting issues behind the corporate firewall/proxy for how the .zip or .tar were being download so I wish others not behind these conditions better luck.

## Additional Notes

Most of the deliverables should be obvious, but the two dynamic elements are both in the Data Exploration portion and are (1) the name change for the table header in the box (bottom-right) when looking at the most popular first round decisions and (2) the extra selection input when checking the box for looking at colleges vs draft position popularity.
